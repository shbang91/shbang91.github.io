I am a PhD Candidate in the Human Centered Robotics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Professor [Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis).
My research interest lies broadly in the whole-body motion planning and control algorithms for deployable and versatile humanoid robots. 
I strongly believe that robust and efficient reactive and predictive whole-body control would enable human-level autonomy and agility for humanoid robots.
